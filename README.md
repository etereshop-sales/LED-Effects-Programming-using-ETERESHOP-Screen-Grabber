<summary><strong>Step 3 – Run the Recorder and Capture Effect</strong></summary>

### Initial Setup

- Open the program.
- Grant permissions on macOS if requested.
- Set the **project path** using the button.
- Ensure `List of errors` displays correct values.

 

### Patch Positioning

![demonstration](images/demonstration2.jpg)

Check the quick start to see how the program will work. To do it you’ll need a project folder (you must have received it from us together with a costume).
Set the project path by clicking on a button with the same name and choose the project folder on your computer. Check the ‘List of errors’. The data must look like that:

![demonstration](images/demonstration3.png)

Press ‘Patch positioning’ button, set patch position by dragging the window and choose the size of an area you want to record effects from.

Patch window is transparent and you can see through it. Close patch window by pressing close button. Program will save the effect to the corresponding folder.

**NOTE! You can’t change patch position or size when effect recording has started.**

Now ‘Start recording’ button must be active. Press ‘Start’ and you will see patch window with recording info string at the top. You can stop recording by pressing standard close window button.

**NOTE! The cursor moving in a selected area won’t be recorded as a future effect. Make sure that no other windows will open during the recording process**

**NOTE! For an example above (Smart LED dress ‘Eva’) we wanted to demonstrate text on a belt. We’ve used Jinx! program but you can also use Madrix software for the same purpose.**
