## Step-by-Step Guide

<details>
<summary><strong>Step 1 – Installation</strong></summary>

### Windows

- Install or update **.NET Framework** (minimum version: 4.5.2). It is included with the recorder installer.
- Run the `.exe` file provided by our team to install the program.
- Close all unnecessary programs before recording — performance depends on your processor.
- Avoid full-screen recording. Use smaller windows for better performance.

### Mac OS

- Install or update **Java** to the latest version.
- Run the recorder using the `.jar` file.
- Allow system permissions if prompted (macOS blocks system control by default).
- Add the software to antivirus whitelist if necessary.

⚠️ If you receive a **mouse hook fail** message, go to **System Preferences → Security & Privacy** → enable checkbox for "Jar Launcher".
